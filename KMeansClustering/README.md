# KMEANS CLUSTERING

## Project

In this project I attempted to group two universities into public or private based off the csv data given to use.

## What is KMeans Clustering

KMeans Clustering is the attempt to partition data into unique groupings by using the nearest mean of each processed vector

## Results

When attempting to use KMeans Clustering, you are suppose to manipulate the data without having specific labels to validate your hypothesis, however in this
project, because there were labels, we are looking at how well the algorithm can perform and what type of results we should generally see. Therefore, the results
are skewed with bias, but the performance of the algorithm worked as predicted.
